<h1>About Me(Satya)</h1>
<p>My name is Satya who brought up in small town called Dharmavaram, where most of people has there occupation as weaving silk sarees.
  I love playing games, spend time with family, roam here and there, have some gossips and love to live a life happily ever.
  My mom is my one and only biggest inspiration who struggled a lot to make their daughters on a success track. She carried me 
  on the river bridge and travelled kilometers to get into her workplace inspite of her diabetes. She is a real gem for the society and
  for my family. I love playing with my elder sister and was blindly listening her words inspite of her lies theroughout my childhood.
  Dad, he was completly involved into the world of helping society, treatig poor people and didn't took chance to take care of family.</p>

<p>Coming to me who didn't like studying that much but you can think me as an average student. After my seventh standard at school
  because of getting motivation from all sides...yes you heard right, I got motivation from all sides except from Nanna. Big motivation from mom
  , Sister and Maths, telugu, Biology, English all teachers and friends. With all the motivation I changed my way of studying.
  Instead of hating it I started understanding it and I remembered that I wrote meanings of each and every hard word in Hindi by asking my
  muslim friends. I changed my pattern of learning and scored very well on my Tenth standard and then scoring good in Top competitional exams
  and got into my SVU where I completed my Electronics and Communication Engineering. During my B.Tech, I had a course to crack GATE exam
  and cracked AIR 666 at got a diamond seat at IIT KANPUR.</p>

<p>IITK is my biggest step and I would like to mould my career with the learnings from my IITK. The knowledge I got, the coding skills I got,
  Professional teachers I got, Amazing Friends I got, Absolute Hearttouching Nature I got in IITK is unremarkable. It was my every day 
  dream before joining IITK. Loving my life and hope this about me will have more and more learnings from failures and 
  Happy endings for each story of my book of life. Signing off urs Jini......</p>
